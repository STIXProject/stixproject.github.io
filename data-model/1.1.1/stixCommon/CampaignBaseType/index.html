<p class="data-model-description">This type represents the STIX Campaign component. It is extended using the XML Schema Extension feature by the STIX Campaign type itself. Users of this type who wish to express a full campaign using STIX must do so using the xsi:type extension feature. The STIX-defined Campaign type is <a href='/data-model/1.1.1/campaign/CampaignType'>CampaignType</a> in the http://stix.mitre.org/Campaign-1 namespace. This type is defined in the campaign.xsd file or at the URL http://stix.mitre.org/XMLSchema/campaign/1.1.1/campaign.xsd.
Alternatively, uses that require simply specifying an idref as a reference to a campaign defined elsewhere can do so without specifying an xsi:type.</p>
