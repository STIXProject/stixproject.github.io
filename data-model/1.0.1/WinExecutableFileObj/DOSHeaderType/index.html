This value must be used to locate the relocation pointer table (rather than assuming a fixed location) because variable-length information pertaining to program overlays can occur before this table, causing its position to vary. A value of 0x40 in this field generally indicates a different kind of executable file, not a DOS 'MZ' type.</p>
