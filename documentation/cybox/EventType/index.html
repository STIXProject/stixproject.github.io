<h1>EventType<span class="subdued">CybOX Core Schema</span></h1>

<p>The EventType is a complex type representing a cyber observable event that is dynamic in nature with specific action(s) taken against specific cyber relevant objects (e.g. a file is deleted, a registry key is created or an HTTP Get Request is received).</p>

          <p>The Type field uses a standardized controlled vocabulary to capture what type of Event this is.</p>
        
          <p>This field is implemented through the xsi:type controlled vocabulary extension mechanism. The default vocabulary type is EventTypeVocab-1.0.1 in the http://cybox.mitre.org/default_vocabularies-2 namespace. This type is defined in the cybox_default_vocabularies.xsd file or at the URL http://cybox.mitre.org/XMLSchema/default_vocabularies/2.0.1/cybox_default_vocabularies.xsd.</p>
        
          <p>Users may also define their own vocabulary using the type extension mechanism (by specifying a vocabulary name and/or reference using the vocab_name and vocab_reference attributes, respectively) or simply use this as a string field.</p>
