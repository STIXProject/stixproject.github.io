<h1>ThreatActorBaseType<span class="subdued">STIX Common Schema</span></h1>

<p>This type represents the STIX Threat Actor component. It is extended using the XML Schema Extension feature by the STIX Threat Actor type itself. Users of this type who wish to express a full threat actor using STIX must do so using the xsi:type extension feature. The STIX-defined Threat Actor type is ThreatActorType in the http://stix.mitre.org/ThreatActor-1 namespace. This type is defined in the threat_actor.xsd file or at the URL http://stix.mitre.org/XMLSchema/threat_actor/1.1.1/threat_actor.xsd.
Alternatively, uses that require simply specifying an idref as a reference to a threat actor defined elsewhere can do so without specifying an xsi:type.</p>
