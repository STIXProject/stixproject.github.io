<h1>ProcessStatusType<span class="subdued">Process Object Schema</span></h1>

<p>The ProcessStatusType is used for specifying the status of a running or terminated process. Since this property is platform-specific, it is created here as an abstract type and then used in the platform-specific process CybOX objects.</p>
