          <p>ARP is a logical protocol used for resolution of network layer addresses (e.g., IP addresses) into link layer addresses (e.g., MAC addresses). RARP is a logical protocol used by a host computer to request its network layer address when it has its link layer address.</p>

          <p>Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is used with IPv6 to determine the link-layer addresses for neighbors. Corresponds to combination of IPv4 protocols: ARP, ICMP Router Discovery, and ICMP Redirect.</p>
