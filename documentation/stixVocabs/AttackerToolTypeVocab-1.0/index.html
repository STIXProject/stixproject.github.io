<h1>AttackerToolTypeVocab-1.0<span class="subdued">STIX Vocabularies Schema</span></h1>

<p>The <a href='/documentation/stixVocabs/AttackerToolTypeVocab-1.0'>AttackerToolTypeVocab-1.0</a> is the default STIX vocabulary for expressing types of attacker tools.
Note that this vocabulary is under development. Feedback is appreciated and should be sent to the STIX discussion list.</p>

      <td>
        
          <p>The is_case_sensitive field is optional and should be used when specifying the case-sensitivity of a pattern which uses an Equals, DoesNotEqual, Contains, DoesNotContain, StartsWith, EndsWith, or FitsPattern condition. The default value for this field is "true" which indicates that pattern evaluations are to be considered case-sensitive.</p>

      <td>
        
          <p>This field indicates how a condition should be applied when the field body contains a list of values. (Its value is moot if the field value contains only a single value - both possible values for this field would have the same behavior.) If this field is set to ANY, then a pattern is considered to be matched if the provided condition successfully evaluates for any of the values in the field body. If the field is set to ALL, then the patern only matches if the provided condition successfully evaluates for every value in the field body.</p>

          <p>Setting this attribute with an empty value (e.g., "") or omitting it entirely notifies CybOX consumers and pattern evaluators that the corresponding regular expression utilizes capabilities, character classes, escapes, and other lexical tokens defined by the CybOX Language Specification.</p>
